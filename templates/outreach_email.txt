Hey there!

I was reviewing {{domain}} and noticed something interesting.

We run a daily scanner that looks at HubSpot implementations across local businesses. If you're open to it, I can share what we found and some suggestions that usually improve leadflow + automations within days.

Let me know if you'd like a quick breakdown.
